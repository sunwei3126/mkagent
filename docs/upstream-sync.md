# Upstream synchronization

MkAgent derives its architecture, UI, and runtime from [Craft Agents OSS](https://github.com/craft-ai-agents/craft-agents-oss). This document defines the workflow for absorbing new Craft changes while staying inside the Lite boundary.

## Baseline (current)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Repository | `craft-ai-agents/craft-agents-oss` |
| Tag | `v0.12.1` |
| Commit | `d7592c481216e37c95a50dbfe08948a6987e8c74` |

When upstream publishes a new tag worth evaluating:

1. Record the new tag and commit: `git -C ../craft-agents-oss rev-parse HEAD && git -C ../craft-agents-oss describe --tags --always`.
2. Add the commit to this document so the "current baseline" stays a single source of truth.
3. Move through the steps below using the new commit.

Reference checkouts (`../craft-agents-oss`, `../echo`, `../xagent`) stay read-only during MkAgent work.

## File-seam classification

| Class | Rule | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| `STRICT_REUSE` | Same relative path, mechanical differences only (scope, URL scheme, config root, brand strings) | `audit:craft-reuse` byte-equal after normalization |
| `LITE_SEAM` | Same relative path with branches removed for excluded features, or wired into MkAgent-only interfaces | Manual semantic review; targeted unit/integration tests; typecheck |
| `REMOVED_FEATURE` | File is removed entirely from MkAgent because the corresponding product area is gone | Path, call sites, build closure, and `lint:craft-test-coverage` tag |

Adding upstream-only features starts with the Lite question first; only features that fit the Lite boundary should be picked up.

## Override manifests

Two source-of-truth files record which MkAgent files deviate from Craft:

- `scripts/craft-source-overrides.json` (tracking all `apps/`, `packages/` source files)
- `scripts/craft-ui-overrides.json` (renderer-focused subset, 112 entries)

After any sync, both files **must** be regenerated and reviewed. The intent is that `audit:craft-reuse` only passes because the deviation is justified, not because the hash table was bumped to match.

## What is not eligible for sync

- Claude Agent SDK backend and the `claude-agent-sdk*` packages; keep the retained Claude OAuth flow routed through Pi
- GitHub Copilot, generic/Sources OAuth, and their SDKs
- External messaging gateway and workers
- Sources, MCP server, bridge MCP server, MCP-related UI
- Image generation models and `gen_image`
- Public sharing, Viewer app
- Product automations and the scheduler UI
- Sources API/Settings UI, session labels, user-defined statuses
- WhatsApp worker

These are recorded as Lite-boundary deletions in [`comparison-with-craft.md`](./comparison-with-craft.md) and the [`migration/`](./migration/README.md) archive.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `audit:craft-reuse` reports a file diverged unexpectedly | You forgot to refresh override hashes after a seam change | regenerate `scripts/craft-source-overrides.json`, audit the diff before accepting |
| `lint:craft-test-coverage` shows a "missing" tag | A Craft test moved or was added without classification | update the seam classification in `scripts/check-craft-test-coverage.ts` |
| Type error in `apps/electron/src/main` only after a sync | Upstream introduced a new env var or platform helper | confirm it survives the Lite seam; document before commit |
| Renderer asset 404 in packaged build | New Craft asset added without updating `scripts/copy-assets.ts` | add the asset to the copy list and rebuild |
| `electron:build` succeeds but `MkAgent Helper` lacks a Claude/Sources plugin | Confirm `appId` is `app.mkagent.desktop` and `@mkagent/*` is the only scope in `extraResources` | check `apps/electron/electron-builder.yml` |
