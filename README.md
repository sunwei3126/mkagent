MkAgent is an open-source, local-first AI agent workspace for anyone who wants more control over
their AI work. Download and use it through Desktop, WebUI, or CLI, or extend its open-source
foundation to build your own desktop agent product. Powered by the
[Pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) agent runtime, it combines persistent local workspaces,
model flexibility, browser tools, and document tools in one application.
Application state stays under your local data directory, and credentials are stored through the
operating system credential manager.

## Features

- **Local-first workspaces** — keep sessions, files, settings, and workspace history on your machine.
- **Flexible model connections** — use ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro/Max, provider API keys,
  OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible endpoints, and local Ollama models.
- **Desktop, WebUI, and CLI** — work through the Electron app, a browser-based renderer, or an RPC
  command-line client backed by the same runtime.
- **Agent workflows** — create and branch sessions, build plans, use Skills, resume work, manage
  follow-ups, and run multiple windows.
- **Built-in tools** — browse the web, work with attachments, render Markdown and code, and inspect
  or transform common document formats.
- **Explicit control** — choose Explore, Ask, or Execute permission modes, configure a network
  proxy, and switch between English and Simplified Chinese.

## Tech Stack

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) — Workspace runtime, package manager, scripts, and tests.
- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) — Cross-platform desktop application shell.
- [React](https://react.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) — Shared user
  interface and typed application code.
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) — Renderer tooling and styling.
- [Pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) — Agent runtime, model providers, sessions, and tool execution.

## Interfaces

| Interface | Best for | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop | Full local experience and browser pane | `bun run electron:dev` |
| WebUI | Browser access to the headless server | See [WebUI](./docs/webui.md) |
| CLI | Scripting, remote control, and terminal workflows | `bun run apps/cli/src/index.ts --help` |

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3.14 or later
- Node.js 18 or later
- Git
- Python 3.12 and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for the complete document-tool test suite

### Run the Desktop app

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MkThingsHQ/mkagent.git
cd mkagent
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run electron:dev
```

MkAgent creates its default workspace at `~/.mkagent/workspaces/default`. The configuration root can
be isolated for development or testing with `CONFIG_DIR=/path/to/directory`.

### Common commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `bun run electron:dev` | Start the Electron development environment |
| `bun run electron:start` | Build and launch Electron once |
| `bun run server:prod` | Build and start the headless server with WebUI (needs `MKAGENT_SERVER_TOKEN`; [WebUI](./docs/webui.md)) |
| `bun run cli:build` | Build the CLI bundle |
| `bun run test` | Run unit and isolated tests |
| `bun run validate:ci` | Run the full type, test, document-tool, and localization gate |

More commands and environment variables are documented in the
[development guide](./docs/development.md) and [WebUI runbook](./docs/webui.md).

## Architecture

MkAgent is a Bun workspace with a shared runtime and renderer across its three interfaces:

```text
apps/
  electron/              Electron main, preload, renderer, and Browser pane
  webui/                 Browser adapter for the shared renderer
  cli/                   RPC command-line client
packages/
  core/                  Stable DTOs, events, and error contracts
  shared/                Configuration, credentials, prompts, Skills, theme, and i18n
  ui/                    Shared React UI and content renderers
  server-core/           RPC transport, sessions, and runtime orchestration
  server/                Headless server
  pi-agent-server/       Pi agent subprocess
  session-tools-core/    Plans, Skills, browser, and session tools
```

Read the [architecture guide](./docs/architecture.md) for runtime boundaries, process ownership, and
data flow.
